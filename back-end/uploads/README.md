# Uploads Directory

This directory stores user-uploaded files:
- **org-logos/** - Organization logos

Files in this directory are:
- **Persisted locally** when running with ./start.sh or ./dev.sh
- **Shared with Docker** when running with docker-compose
- **Not committed to git** (see .gitignore)

The directory structure is created automatically on first upload.
